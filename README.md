# youtube-downloader
For this converter, I had the idea of creating it to avoid relying on websites that limit us in terms of time and the quality of conversions, such as to MP4. This converter allows you to download as many videos as you want in the best default quality of the video. Additionally, it also takes into account the metadata of YouTube videos, enabling features like retrieving the thumbnail of the desired video

# Installation
To do this, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
- yt_dlp

You can install it using the following command:
`pip install yt_dlp`


If you are on linux, you can execute this commands : `cd /tmp ; git clone https://github.com/killex8569/youtube-downloader.git ; cd youtube-downloader ; chmod +x install.sh ; ./install.sh`  

# how to use it ?

This converter will create a directory named "video" where you can store the videos you have downloaded. Note that this folder will be located in the root directory where your Python file is placed. For better usability, I recommend creating a dedicated directory where both your file and folders will be stored
